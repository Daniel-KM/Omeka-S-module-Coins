[COinS] is the module for [Omeka S] that allows to appends the COinS metadata
(or [Z39.88-2004]) in the html code of the items, so they can be fetched
automatically in bibliographic tools such as [Zotero].

This [Omeka S] module is a rewrite of [COinS plugin for Omeka] and
intends to provide the same features as the original plugin.

The COinS can be accessed via the api with the module [Api Info] through the url
"/api/infos/coins" + a search query.

This version is a fix / improvement of the module of [BibLibre].
